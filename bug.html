<p>This HTML snippet demonstrates an uncommon error: using a reserved keyword as an attribute name.</p><pre><code>&lt;div class="my-div" for="my-element"&gt;This is some text&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>The attribute <code>for</code> is a reserved keyword in HTML (it's used to associate a label with a form element).  While browsers might not always throw an error, using it incorrectly could lead to unexpected behavior and hinder JavaScript interactions with the element.  It's best to avoid using reserved words as attributes and opt for descriptive custom names.</p>
